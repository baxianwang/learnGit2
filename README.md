# learnGit2
Master Branch: Learn git commands. 
Let us try to something hard. 

1. Learned git clone, git pull. 
2. learned git config

Making changes on top of master branch. 
Would like to learn more on git merge and git rebase. 
If we move repo master one more step, what happen?
Keep moving

Would like to try merge again with tools.
